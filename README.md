"MTG_2021_MASTER_THESIS" 

Felix's master project, mainly about source separation, utilising the mixing secrect multitrack dataset. Auto mixing is also considered as a potential study subject.

First, I will learn deep learning: study and build basline model from scratch.
Second, use custom dataset to train baseline models.

New stems: Lead vocal and backing vocal need to be separated. Utilising score-informed methods. mannually make scores for BV, LV and then use them to feed neural networks as additional information.
