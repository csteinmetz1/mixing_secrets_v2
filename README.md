# MS21: A NEW VERSION OF MIXING SECRETS DATASET FOR MUSIC SOURCE SEPARATION

This is an accompanying repository of a submission to Late Breaking Demo of International Society of Music Information Retrieval 2022: 

This repository contains scripts for 1) Data Gathering from Mixing Secret Website; 2) Semi-automatically annotation generation; 2) Basic DSP for audio files :Resampling, zero-padding, "monorizing", loudness normalization; 4) Automatic Stem generation and Formatting: Same folder structure of MedleyDB and special automatic mixing algorithm for generating stereo backing vocal stem.
